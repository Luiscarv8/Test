Ken and Santi, 

As we continue to work on the set of reports that will be affected by the new Actimize server, I have a question regarding a missing table in the XUDM database. 

The report I am currently working on is the Actimize SARS Filed by Customer TIN Prod. 

This DART report is connected to:

Server:MSDCAMZPRDDB2.lighthouse.hhc\ACTIMIZE
Database: RCM

SELECT
                vaf.form_name  "SAR Name",
                vaf.form_status  "Status",
                vaf.create_date  "Created",
                vaf.last_update_date  "Last updated", 
                vaft.name  "Type", 
                vac.case_identifier  "Case ID", 
                vac.case_date  "Case date",
                vact.name  "Case type", 
                vau.login_name  "Case owner"
FROM
                v_acm_forms   vaf,
                v_acm_form_types   vaft,
                v_acm_cases   vac,
                v_acm_users2   vau,
                v_acm_case_types   vact
WHERE
                vaf.form_type_join_id = vaft.form_type_join_id
                and vaf.case_join_id = vac.case_join_id
                and vac.owner_join_id = vau.user_join_id
                and vac.case_type_join_id = vact.case_type_join_id
                and vaft.identifier in ('RCM_SAR_Form', 'RCM_SARDI_Form')
                and vaf.form_xml like '%' + @TIN + '%'
ORDER BY
                VAF.create_date desc


As I am going through the MSDCETLAZUATDB1\ACTIMIZE server and XUDM database I have been able to map every individual table back to the legacy RCM tables except for the table highlighted in yellow v_acm_cases. 

Would you happen to know more information about this specific table? Perhaps it is mapped with a different name, or it has not flowed through the UAT environment just yet. 

Additionally, we have noticed that while working on the other reports in the request, the MSDCETLAZUATDB1\ACTIMIZE server query processing run times are significantly longer than anything we run on MSDCAMZPRDDB2.lighthouse.hhc\ACTIMIZE or MSDCAMZPRDDB3.lighthouse.hhc\ACTIMIZE by a large order of magnitude. Is there a reasonable explanation for this difference? 

Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to clarify anything

Best,
